               The dish strikes a perfect balance between creamy and tangy flavors,with a hint of sweetness from the cashew
                paste and cream.</p>
                <p>The preparation of Paneer Butter Masala involves sautéing onions, garlic, and ginger until aromatic, 
                    then simmering them with ripe tomatoes until they form a thick and smooth gravy.
                     Cashew paste adds a creamy consistency and a subtle nutty flavor, while a combination of spices such as turmeric, 
                     chili powder, garam masala, coriander, and cumin infuses the dish with warmth and depth.</p>  
                     <p>This dish is a popular choice in Indian restaurants and homes alike,
                         often served as a main course with naan, roti, or steamed rice.

                        <h2>LET'S START WITH IT</h2> 
                        <h3> INGREDIENTS: </h3>
<ul>
   <li>250 grams paneer (Indian cottage cheese), cubed.</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons butter or ghee (clarified butter).</li>
   <li>1 large onion, finely chopped.</li>
   <li> large tomatoes, pureed.</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste.</li>
   <li>2 green chilies, finely chopped (optional, for spice).</li>
   <li>10-12 cashew nuts, soaked in water.</li>
   <li>1/4 cup heavy cream or fresh cream.</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder.</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon red chili powder.</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder.</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder.</li>
   <li>Salt, to taste.</li>
   <li>Sugar, to taste (optional, to balance flavors).</li>
   <li>Water, as needed.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3> INSTRUCTIONS/STEPS: </h3>
 <ol>
   <li> Heat 1 tablespoon of butter or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the cubed paneer and lightly fry them until they turn golden brown on all sides. Remove the paneer cubes and set them aside.</li>
   <li>In the same pan, add the remaining tablespoon of butter or ghee. Once melted, add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.</li>
   <li>Add the ginger-garlic paste and chopped green chilies (if using). Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw aroma of ginger-garlic disappears.</li>
   <li>Add the pureed tomatoes to the pan and cook until the mixture thickens and the oil starts to separate from the sides.</li>
   <li>Meanwhile, in a blender, blend the soaked cashew nuts with a little water to make a smooth paste.</li>
   <li>Once the tomato mixture is cooked, add the cashew paste and mix well.</li>
   <li>Now add the turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and salt to taste. Stir well to combine all the spices with the tomato-cashew mixture.</li>
   <li>Pour in some water to adjust the consistency of the gravy according to your preference. Let the gravy simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend together.</li>
   <li>Add the fried paneer cubes to the gravy and mix gently, ensuring the paneer is well coated with the sauce.</li>
   <li>Crush the kasuri methi between your palms and sprinkle it over the paneer butter masala. Stir it in gently.</li>
   <li>Finally, add the heavy cream or fresh cream to the pan, stirring continuously. Let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
   <li>Taste the paneer butter masala and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you prefer a slightly sweet taste, you can add a pinch of sugar at this stage.</li>
   <li>Once done, turn off the heat and transfer the paneer butter masala to a serving dish.</li>
   <li>Garnish with a drizzle of cream and some finely chopped coriander leaves.</li>
