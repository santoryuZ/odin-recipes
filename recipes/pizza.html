        <p>Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil,
             oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly. Usually,
              in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>

              <p>One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita,
                 which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil.
                 Popular legend relates that it was named for Queen Margherita, wife of Umberto I, who was said to have liked
                  its mild fresh flavour and to have also noted that its topping colours (green,
                 white, and red) were those of the Italian flag.</p>

        <h3> STEPS/INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
        <ol>
             <li><strong> <em> STEP-1;</em> Prepare the Dough:</strong>
           <ul> 
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture
                     and olive oil. Stir until a dough forms.</li>
                <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.
                       Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap,
                       and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>STEP-2;</em>Make the Sauce:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Add crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>STEP-3;</em>Assemble the Pizza:</strong>
               <ul> 
                 <li> Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, usually around 475°F (245°C) to 500°F (260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
                 <li> Punch down the risen dough and divide it into desired portions. Roll out each portion into a circle or rectangle, depending on your preference and the shape of your baking sheet or pizza stone.</li>
                 <li> Place the rolled out dough on a baking sheet or pizza peel lined with parchment paper. Spread the sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                 <li> Arrange the mozzarella cheese slices or torn pieces evenly over the sauce. Add any desired toppings.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong><em>STEP-4</em>Bake the Pizza:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the assembled pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. Otherwise, place the baking sheet directly in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>     
            <li> <h4>Serve and Enjoy!</h4> </li>
